Version 0.9.2 - Not Released

	02.01.2010

	- Memory leak in imageSetStyle.
	- Memory leak in TextureImage::Compress( ).
	- Added destructors to structs which contain allocated memory pointers which automatically clean up after me. :)
	- Since I hate warnings added _SECURE_SCL functions when compiling on WIN32.
	- Source Cleanup
	- Added function txdContainerAddImagePtr - Add image from image ptr.
	
	- txdContainerAddImage now automatically switches between the following functions based on parameters:
	
		* txdContainerAddImage - From png, gif and jpeg files...
		* txdContainerAddImagePtr - From image pointers.
